# CRUD
It's crud(Create-Read-Update-Delete) through Node.js using express framework
I made this project on webstorm 2018.1.5 through **Node.js** and **MongoDB** using **Express** framework
-->All files are given
-->And you can check the version of dependecies in the package.json file
To install dependencies you have use "npm install --save 'dependency'"you can do this with the help of the "git bash"
You have to install Node.js express. You can run this code in ubuntu then you dont have to use webstorm.
After installing the MongoDB you have to first run the mongod file in the mongodb folder- which is server for mongodb then you can run the mongo file-database. 
To check the commands of the mongodb visit [Mongodb website](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/crud/)
>While working on the read(get) function you'll get empty array on the local host, it will happen because of the empty db. Insert the data then test it.
**/login** will show you option then you can test the CRUD by the options given.
In code I made the separate html files which call each other through **action** given in the form in the html and then these separate html files for CRUD call the backend of the crud in server.js and do the action.
